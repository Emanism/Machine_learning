## Car Sales Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the 'Car_sales.csv' dataset, exploring various statistical aspects using Python. The analysis focuses on different dimensions of car sales data, offering insights into manufacturer distributions, vehicle types, pricing, and more.

##Tools and Libraries Used
Python: A versatile programming language, ideal for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Key Analyses Conducted
Data Preparation: The dataset was cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates, ensuring the integrity of subsequent analyses.

Variable Identification: We identified variable types within the dataset, distinguishing between numerical and categorical data.

## Graphical Analysis:

Bar Graph: Illustrated the frequency of cars by manufacturer.
Pie Chart: Showcased the distribution of vehicle types as a percentage of the total.
Central Tendency Analysis: Computed the average price of cars, providing an insight into the general pricing trend in the dataset.

Variance and Standard Deviation: These statistical measures were calculated for key numerical columns, offering insights into data spread and variability.

Interquartile Range (IQR) and Outliers: Identified the IQR for numerical columns to detect outliers, aiding in understanding the distribution characteristics of the data.

Histograms and Skewness: Generated histograms for all numerical columns and calculated skewness to understand the distribution shapes and asymmetry in the data.

## Outcomes and Insights
The analysis revealed the distribution of vehicle types and the prevalence of different manufacturers in the dataset.
We calculated the average price of cars, providing valuable insights into the market's pricing structure.
The variance and standard deviation calculations highlighted the variability and dispersion in car sales, resale values, and other numerical factors.
By analyzing IQR and outliers, we gained insights into the typical range of values and identified exceptional cases in the dataset.
Histograms and skewness calculations allowed us to visualize and quantify the distribution of numerical data, revealing trends and patterns not immediately apparent.
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to basic statistical analysis and visualization in Python, leveraging popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
